React-design-selector
=====================

## Stubbing out a design selector using React.js and Flux

This app requires node.js!

With node installed, you will also need to install **gulp** globally:

`npm install -g gulp`

Install the local dependencies:

`npm install`

Run the gulp build:

`gulp`

Serve the dist folder in your web server of choice. Httpster is a great option for this (`npm i -g httpster`).

`cd dist`
`httpster`

Optional watch mode:
`gulp watch`
